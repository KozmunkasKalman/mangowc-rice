# My MangoWC Rice

This is my setup on my Arch and NixOS systems.

List of required software for this config to work without modifications:
- mangowc
- dunst
- xfce-polkit
- waybar
- hyprpaper
- wl-clip-persist
- wl-paste
- wl-copy
- kitty
- vim
- yazi
- kew
- thunar
- ristretto
- parole
- xarchiver
- mpv
- brave
- rofi
- grim
- slurp
- swappy
- wlsunset
- pavucontrol

This includes a custom color scheme, which I have titled "Kotyog√≥s" (means moka pot in Hungarian), and is based on Espresso Libre.

I also included my custom fetch script as a bonus, that is very broken on other systems and distro or hardware support is not guaranteed even remotely, but it works on my machine, so...
If you know a way to fix it, make a PR and I'll add it.

Preferred icon theme is [Cawnonical](https://www.pling.com/p/2298642)
Preferred cursor theme is [Bibata Modern Ice](https://www.pling.com/p/1197198)
Preferred GTK theme is [Graphite](https://www.pling.com/p/1598493), edited to match the color scheme.

Rofi config is edited version of [Aditya Shakya (adi1090x)'s Rofi Theme](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi), more specifically the Type-4 Style-2 Launcher

Feel free to use anything from this (or even all of it) for whatever you want, whenever.
