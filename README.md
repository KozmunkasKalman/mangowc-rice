# My MangoWC Rice

This is my setup on my Arch system.

List of required software:
- any orthodox fhs following linux distribution (in this case arch for example), although with some tweaking can most likely work on any distro
- bash
- xdg-user-dirs
- xdg-desktop-portal
- xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
- gvfs
- mangowc
- dunst
- xfce-polkit
- waybar
- swww
- hyprlock
- wl-clipboard
- kitty
- thunar
- rofi
- grim
- slurp
- swappy
- wlsunset
- pavucontrol
- paru
- fzf

Full list of software used by me with this rice:
- neovim with [nvchad config](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad)
- htop
- brave
- ristretto
- parole
- xarchiver
- gimp
- onlyoffice
- tauon
- nwg-look

I also included a few of my scripts, such as:
- nomadfetch: a fetch script, which is very broken on other hardware, support is not guaranteed at all, and distros might lack icons, but it works on my machine, so... if you know a way to fix it, make a pr and i'll merge it
- gparu: a tui frontend for paru made with fzf, allows you to search for and install packages, update installed packages, look for and remove any installed packages, and clear the cache
- my rofi scripts:
  - web-menu: from there you can either open just a browser, or open specific commonly used websites
  - wallpaper-menu: allows you to pick a wallpaper and set it with swww, by default the wallpapers have to be in ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/
  - layout-selector: with this you can select mangowc tag layouts with ease
  - power-menu: a simple power menu that can run hyprlock, exit mango, reboot, or shutdown

Rofi menu and power menu themes are edited versions of [Aditya Shakya (adi1090x)'s Rofi](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)

TODO:
- desktop icons with pcmanfm
- fix animations for layers
- make a preview video
