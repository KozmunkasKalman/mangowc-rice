# My MangoWC Rice

This is my setup on my Arch and NixOS systems.

List of required software for this config to work without modifications:
- bash
- mangowc
- dunst
- xfce-polkit
- waybar
- swww
- hyprlock
- wl-clip-persist
- wl-paste
- wl-copy
- kitty
- kew
- brave
- thunar
- rofi
- grim
- slurp
- swappy
- wlsunset
- pavucontrol

List of reccommended software
- vim
- ristretto
- parole
- xarchiver

I also included my custom fetch script as a bonus, that is very broken on other systems and distro or hardware support is not guaranteed even remotely, but it works on my machine, so...
If you know a way to fix it, make a PR and I'll merge it.

Rofi config is edited version of [Aditya Shakya (adi1090x)'s Rofi Theme](https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi)

Feel free to use anything from this (or even all of it) for whatever you want, whenever.
